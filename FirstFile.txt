First file of this repository, doesn't count as a README file, but please read this if that isn't setup.
This repository is for the software development, testing, and final production of the Serene Sea Otter's
FEH Robot. Use of this code maliciously or in any untended manner outside of the FEH program is not
premitted by the developers of this code and such no blame can be placed on them. Excluding cases where
the developer explicity permits the use of this code or the developer uses this code for said purpose.

Besides this is a currently private repo (of 2/7/2024), so the above statement probably wasn't needed.
